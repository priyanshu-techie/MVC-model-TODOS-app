here i am using the mvc model where i am separating the model(db connection and management)
, views(the frontend),
and the controllers(what to do on what), 
and also the routers (using express.Router(){built-in express middleware}) for handling routes
 all are separated from each other

and then all the pieces are joined at the server.js file .
